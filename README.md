AAC Beacon is a smart communication tool designed to make finding and using frequently needed words faster and easier. When a user connects to the beacon in a room, it automatically provides access to a personalized set of words without the need to search through files or menus. Each beacon is tailored to the user’s favorite words for that specific room, saving time and improving communication efficiency.
